Technical Project Description of the TUM techchallenge to target the shortage of plastic consumables for COVID-19 PCR tests.

## About us

## Brief Introduction and our Solution Approach

The coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic caused by the COVID-19 disease (for more information to the pandemic we refer to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)).
In order to control this pandemic by disrupting infection chains, PCR tests have been one of the most essential tools so far.
Extensive PCR testing by many countries has lead to shortages and price increases for testing equipment.
Since first world countries have a higher market power and more money to spend compared to third world countries, this development has hit third world countries overproportional more than first world countries.
In particular, third world countries are struggling to get  access to plastic consumables for PCR tests on the world market. These are swabs, tubes, pipette tips, and spin columns.

To dampen the effects of supply shortages of such consumables, we have developed a mobile production table which is capable of producing these consumables within the testing laboratories. Our production plant is optimized to be simply deployable to laboratories in third world countries, to be operable by a low amount of labor, and only requires a minimum amount of training to be operated.
